Following on from my previous post on [Getting Start with GitHub Pages](/blog/github-pages/) this post takes you through getting up and running with the static site generator Jekyll, creating content and publishing the content toGitHub. I will also cover off using custom themes, including some of the tweaks I implemented in setting up this site, adding your own domain, implementing post comments and enabling SSL. 

So lets get started,

# Installing Jekyll
Firstly, what is Jekyll? It is obviously a static site generator (SSG), but more than that is and so the following makes more sense, Jekyll is a Ruby application bundling several packages / plugins called Gems to into a single command line interface to build your site. If you are interesting in learning more about Ruby, please visit the following; 

[Ruby 101](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/ruby-101/)

As Jekyll is a Ruby application the first step is installing Ruby;

## Jekyll on Windows
I will be using Chocolatey for this, further details at [Installing Chocolatey](/blog/github-pages/#install-chocolatey)

## Jekyll on MacOS
I will be using HomBrew for this, further details at [Installing HomeBrew](/blog/github-pages/#install-homebrew)

## Minimal Mistakes Theme
Git is required for this, instructions on installing Git at [Installing Git](/blog/github-pages/#install-homebrew)

## Customising your site with Jekyll
- config file
- bio details
- custom css

## Creating a post with Jekyll
- creating a markdown file
- general markdown concepts
- serve locally
- push to github
- draft posts

## Push you site to GitHub 
- push to github using command line
- push to github using vs code

## Extra's
### custom domains
### comments / analytics 
### other options
    - other jekyll themes
    - static site generators compatible with github
