Thought about starting a blog for many years, thought stuck at home due to global pandamtic would force my hand, so 4 months into that pandemtic i have finally got it going

Why the delay? thought i had nothin useful to day, everything i wanted say some one had already created that content, being ridiculed by peers, thinking i don't have time for that

My career as spanned the full spectrum of it roles, helpdesk to management. With a career working solely for large manufacturing organisations I have have always had the 'luxury' of working with on-premise infrastructure, this has been limiting in its exposure to modern devops practises and techniques.

i'm using this blog to force my hand in developing my skils in these area's

topics including;

- vmware
- docker
- jenkins
- ansible
- terraform
- credential management - hashicorp vault
- source control - git
- monitoring - prometheus
- logging - elk
- cmdb
