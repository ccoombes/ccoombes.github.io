Following on from my previous post on [Getting Start with GitHub Pages](/blog/github-pages/) this post takes you through setting up you workstation to build your site using Jekyll. I will also cover using custom themes, including some of the tweaks I implemented in setting up this site.

# jekyll setup
- installing ruby (mac / windows)
- installing required ruby gems
- serving page locally
- push to github using command line
- push to github using vs code

# jekyll customisation
- config file
- bio details
- custom css

# creating a post with jekyll
- creating a markdown file
- general markdown concepts
- serve locally
- push to github
- draft posts

# what next
- custom domains
- comments / analytics 
- other options
    - other jekyll themes
    - static site generators compatible with github
